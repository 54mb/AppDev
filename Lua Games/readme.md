# iOS Games Written and Deployed to Apple App Store
--- 

## Purpose:
The goal of these games was mostly just to have fun writing them. 
Great practice navigating Xcode, iTunesConnect, and Apple Developer.


## Outcome:
Games deployed to iOS App Store.
Over 10,000 downloads to date, in all App Store sales regions.
Currently not live due to cost of developer fees.


All Lua code written by me.
Objective-C Game Center code also by me.
Codea [https://codea.io] environment used to generate other Objective-C code.

*Disclaimer: I was 15 at the time, so code is poorly commented.*
